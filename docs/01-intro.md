# About us

## Connect For Pleasure Of Allah

### ٱللَّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ

As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa-raḥmatu -llāhi wa-barakātuhū

May the peace, mercy and blessings of our Lord be upon you

As muslims we are souls having a human experience. When we come together, standing shoulder to shoulder the tranquility and connection we feel as we pray and intimately interact with our creator helps us cultivate richer and more meaningful lives.
All over America, there are entire communities built around Masjids that help each of us move closer to Allah and contribute towards growing our Ummah and developing prophetic character. Maybe you are a new muslim and not sure how to connect with your community, or maybe you're an introvert and feel hesitant to ask about current masjid activities or maybe you just want to know whats going on in the muslim community. 

We started this initiative with the goal of connecting and empowering people in our communities to come together and spend quality time together. 

We also aimed to provide Masjids and organizations with a free platform for community members to find them and to grow their congregation and student body. Ultimately to encourage a more conscious, welcoming and prophetic way of life. 


### Come to prayer! Come to Success!
