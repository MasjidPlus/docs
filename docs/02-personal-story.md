# Personal story

I was part of big Muslim community and was at the masjid every day for at least fajr and isha. I wanted to do more, but the masjid simply didn't have a lot of stuff going on, or at least not to my knowledge at the time. Once I started talking to everyone about the events and activities going on around, I realized there was more stuff going on than I was aware of. 


So I started digging around. I went on their website, which took a long time to load, and required a lot of patience on its own. (I remembered reading an article where  Amazonâ€™s calculated that a page load of just one second could cost it $1.6 billion in sales each year.). Once the site loaded, I noticed that it was outdated, unclean, and finding the information I need was becoming a challenge. Looking at the prayer times widget, I noticed iqamah was inacurate. It was standard prayer times widget showing adhan for the city and had nothing to do with iqamah times at a specific masjid. Upon further search I finally found pdf of prayer times, which were correct, but it was not an easy task.

I went on their facebook page and while it was far better than the actual website organization wise, it still didn't have much information.

Once I found out about newsletter I subscribed to it. When I got my first newsletter I noticed it provided the most amount of information, however it was still missing some of the activities I knew of. When I received the second newsletter, I had to spend time looking and scrolling down the pages to realize it was nearly identical to the first one, yet I get it every week.


I had spent nearly an hour searching the iformation, from their website to social media. Who was willing to invest so much time and effort into finding out what is going on in their community?






I always loved visiting new masjids, and one day I was traveling to a nearby city and decided to visit all masjids within 20 minute driving distance. All masjids in this specific area were small , everyone was super friendly and each one felt like home. However they all had very little going on, which is very understandable. Few resources can only do so much. We humans love habits, so I noticed my habbit of being regular at the masjid could prove to be a challenge this case... or would it? What I also noticed that while each masjid had very little going on, combined, they had a lot going on. One masjid had volleyball tournaments sunday mornings, other had soccer wednesday and saturday evening. Some had events on some days and other had lectures on other days and between them all they had enough to keep every soul connected to the masjids.

I reflected back to my own city and realized that I knew nothing about any other masjid except the one I was going to. How many of my brothers and sisters are in the same boat as me?

Then I decided to create a poll and asked my brothers and sisters about how often they go to masjid and what would encourage them to attend more frequently. The results were all the same. They would attent far more, they just needed information, and on their own terms.



Information simply isn't available, or at least not intuatively.
The question was, how do I stay infromed of what is going on in my community. And most importantly, how do I know what is going on when "I" wanted to know. I remember reading articles about advertisement and how they mentioned that you probably don't need car insurance and seeing its commercial when you still have 6 month contract on your existing insurance doesn't really do you much good, so the key is being able to find the car insurance when YOU need it. 


I realized that only solution to this problem is we need infromation and neatly organized information. However nothing out there provided that for Muslim communities. Closest to it is Facebook, but lets face it, how much of the stuff you see on facebook is actually relevant to what you want. Last time I went on facebook, as I was scrolling down for at least 5 posts, while I was wondering why am I seeing these unacceptable posts, and thats when I noticed that they're all advertisements.


So what is so difficult about information? I asked one of our volunteers how long does it take them to create our printable Iqamah times for the next 3 months and the answer was 2 hours using excel.

I knew that with my skills I can help create tools which will simply the jobs of our volunteers, so I decided to start that project with Masjid Plus.
