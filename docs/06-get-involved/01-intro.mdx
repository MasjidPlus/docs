# Get involved

If you would like to join Masjid Plus initiative and do your part in helping our communities grow, please read on.


## Our purpose
Our purpose is very simple. We want to help our community grow. 
We do this by:
* making prayer place management job easer so they can focus on cimunity
* helping communities find whats going on in prayer places around them so they can be involved



## History
Prayer place I was going to had very few events which made me wish there was a lot more going on. Only after I got super involved did I realize there were few more events which only handful people knew of. 


I love visiting new prayer places but at times I would spend 30 or more minutes out of my way to visit a prayer place just to find it locked and I had to pray outside. That sort of made me stick to one prayer place that I knew was open or knew how to get in.

Finding details on each prayer place was a hustle and took much time. Some prayer places had facebook, twitter, and their own website, but were only active on one and sometimes none. Some bigger Masjids had all, and while they had a lot of content, it was not well organized and difficult to navigate through. Each attempt was struggle on its own which took time.

One day while in new city, I decided to visit all prayer places I could find on google within 15 minute driving distance. 
I went to one Masjid, and realized there isn't much going on. Fully understandable. They're a small place with small congregation, so they can only do so much. However, what they had was an amazing volleyball tournaments every sunday and a class or two in between.
Then I went to another Masjid, and it happened to be just as small. They had few weekly events on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
My third Masjid was slightly bigger with lectures on Wed and basketball tournaments Fridays.
Fourth Masjid had few extra classes during the week and Soccer tournaments on saturday.

Thats when I realized there is a lot going on in our communities, we just don't know about it. 

My wish is to help create something where management can share their knowledge to make each others lives easier so they can focus on the community.
And where congregation can easily find out what is going on in their masjids and get involved in the community.



We understand the management struggles with many things such as keeping the doors unlocked when community is small, or struggle with cameras and speaker system to work properly just to name a few.


###### We hope to be part of a solution to as many challenges as possible.
