# How can you help?
1. Feedback: we love feedback :). Tell us what you love and what we can do to improve
2. Testing. You can help us test our app in any way. We would love for you to break it, so we can fix it ;)
3. Development. If you are a developer, we can always use your help. You can find our code on github and make your contribution.
  - Our front end is made with React and Material UI (https://mui.com)
  - Our backend is using NodeJS
  You can help with any of the items on our todo list or you can make anything you believe would be very useful to the community.
4. You can help us improve our documention
5. You help with research for best tools to use. Research takes times, which takes away from our develpment.
6. Content moderation. Some content moderation is more sensitive, so it requires special roles.



# Content moderation

### 1. Possible places of worship
We start by crawling search engines looking for prayer places. Due to the lack of resources, our focus is only USA for now.
Once the prayer places are found, we need someone to:
 - click on the link and view the wesbite
 - if it is a Masjid website
    - we need to check if it exists on our site
    - if it doesnt exist, we need to create it
    - then we need to click save button so our crawlers can extract relevant information how users can find them.
  - if its not a Masjid website, we need to remove it from our search results.



### 2. Subscription
Once we know of a prayer place, we check to see if they have newsletter Subscription, and if so, we subscribe to it so we can know what is going on their community. 


### 3. Website 
Our automation checks Masjid websites and updates our site to make sure our site has the latest changes and we need help inspecting the results.

### 4. Newsletters
Once we receive newsletter, out automation posts it on Masjid Plus. 
Newsletters usually have events or prayer time changes so we need someone to look through these newsletters, create events and update Masjid Plus accordingly. Dont worry, we have it nicely organized ðŸ˜€ haha.
