# Developers
As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa-raḥmatu -llāhi wa-barakātuhū
In the name of Allah, the most merciful.


Our hard work is for Allah and our community. We are not looking for any profit of this life, nor are we accepting any donations. 

We are willing to share all our hard work with anyone with good intentions and are calling on all our Muslim developers to create something amazing for our community or join forces with us so can do it together.


If you have any questions or would like to get in touch with us, please send us an [Email](mailto:masjidplus@gmail.com)
