#  Overview
Digital Display allows you to display your prayer times, events, and anything you would like on your TV inside your prayer places.


All data is pulled directly from your prayer space so Donation links you add to the prayer space are the Donation links available in Donations modules. 
Once you make changes to the prayer space, its automatically available on the Digital Dispaly / TV Screens.




### Template Showcase 
Just a few templates we have created to get you started.
And of course, you can modify any template or create one from scratch.

Templates are created for 16/9 display which is most of TV's these days, however, some of the devices available to display content to the TV, zoom in on the page making things look off, mostly font size so if font size looks too big or too small, please adjust font size in the theme settings
