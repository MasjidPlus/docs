# Overview
We all know the importance of prayer times, specifically Iqamah times (congregational prayer), so we try to make this as simple as possible.


We make it easy to:

- create congregational prayer times
- print the prayer times so they can posted be in prayer space
- display prayer times directly on the TV (read more about digital display **[here](/docs/administrators/digital-display/overview)**)
