# Join as administrator

In order to be able to administer a prayer space, first you need to join prayer space as Imam or Board Member.
You can do so by visiting your prayer space page, and in the sidebar under memebrships, select appropriate title and click join.

After you have been approved, you will have full access to the page to post as you wish.
