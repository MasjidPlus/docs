Templates are created for 16/9 display which is most of TV's these days, however, some of the devices displaying content to the TV (such as Amazon Fire Stick), zoom in on the page enlarging font size with other things. We are auto adjusting these modifications but its impossible to create universal rule, so if the font seems little off, please adjust it manually under Theme tab.




## Simple Overview
* Using you TV (Fire Stick) navigate to your prayer space. 
* Click on Menu and select "TV Screens"
* In digital display select any theme you wish 
* view in Full Screen

And thats it. Now all the changes you make to your prayer space, will be visible on your TV.





## Content
All content is pulled directly from your prayer space. 
For example: once you add donation links to your prayer space, all the links will be available to the Digital Display, so if you're using Donations module on your TV, then all the links will show up as QR Codes to simplify user donations.

Same applies to Prayer Times, Events, Posts, Messages, etc...

All modules are customizable.
Events modules display all of your events, which you can further customize if you wish to do so. Example: you can filter only Sisters events in sisters prayer area.

All posts created within one week are available in Posts module. If you wish to customize even further, you can use tags to filter posts in the module settings.


## Detailed Overview
Digital Display is page with background image, and modules positioned throughout the screen.
If you want to add prayer times to your display, then just add prayer times module, move it your desired location on the screen, and customize it as you wish by right clicking on the modules (or top right edit icon). Set the dimensions of height and width to adjust the size, then change whatever other settings that module has to customize it even further.
